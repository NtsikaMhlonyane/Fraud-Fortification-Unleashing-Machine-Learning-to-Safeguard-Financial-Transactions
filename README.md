- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset (creditcard.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
README.md: Project documentation.
requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.
## Data
The project uses the credit card fraud dataset (data/creditcard.csv). The dataset includes various features, such as time, amount, and anonymized numerical features, with a binary 'Class' column indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).

## Preprocessing
The data preprocessing involves handling missing values, scaling features, and oversampling the minority class using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## Training
The model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier after preprocessing the data.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC score.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, providing a robust defense against financial fraud.

## Conclusion
Our Fraud Detection System offers a powerful solution for enhancing financial security, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
